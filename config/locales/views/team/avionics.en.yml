        desc: "One of the most important tasks of the avionics team is to ensure that the electronic systems used in the glider are reliable and capable of operating in the harsh environment of high-altitude flight. They must consider factors such as temperature, radiation, and vibration, and design systems that can withstand these conditions while still collecting accurate data."
        desc2: "Throughout the project, the avionics team keeps detailed records and performs rigorous testing to ensure that all electronic systems are functioning properly.  These systems include sensors for collecting data on the atmosphere and surface of the Earth, as well as communication and control systems to allow the glider to be controlled remotely and to transmit data back to the ground. They work closely with the other teams to ensure that the glider is designed and built in a way that allows for optimal performance and data collection."

        title: "Meet our Avionics team lead:" 
        text: "As the Avionics and Flight Control Lead, I coordinate a team of interdisciplinary engineers to design, manufacture and implement the avionics systems necessary for the UAV and capsule. These include communicating the telemetry data and developing flight control algorithms for the UAV to maintain steady level flight."
